# Word-Autocomplete

This project is a fast implementation of the autocomplete functionality.
The autocomplete task is to quickly retrieve the top terms that match a query string. For example, if the query string is "Eng", you matches might be "English", "Engineering", and "EngSci".

The algorithm is trained with files that contain a large number of terms, along with the importance weight associated with those terms.
